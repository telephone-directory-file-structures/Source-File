## Abstract
The main objective of this system is to store the contact details of the desired persons in a database.
It is a friendly easy to use interface developed in Java with File Structures as the backend to store the details.
This application stores all the details like name, telephone number, address, email id and website in a file.
This system was developed to reduce the errors that creep up in manual systems.
It was very difficult to store all the details manually there such a system was developed.
This software also allows to edit, update and search various contact details.
It is secure, easy to use and reliable software system.
It also provides a good level of security as only the authorized user can edit and update details.
Earlier where there was only a manual system which required a lot of paperwork but now an automated system is
developed which meet all the requirements.

### Purpose of the project
A telephone directory system for users enrolled for searching for another enrolled user’s information.
The search can be done by providing the first and last name of the user to obtain the contact details and vice versa
(The system behaves as the mobile application True Caller).

### Scope
The main aim of this system is to develop a program that allows users to enrol in the telephone directory.
The users are requested to sign-in if they don’t hold an account in the system.
The new users are asked to provide a username and password which are hashed a stored.
The hash is form of security and a parameter to search when the user is logging in in the future.
The user can edit, modify, enrol, search by name and search by phone number using this system.

##Software Requirement Specification
The telephone directory system allows storing contact details in a database which is handled by the authorized users.
So, this provides a secure system which could easily search, edit or update any records.
It also allows to easily update the contact details without modifying much.
The records can be modified only by the administrator. In this, you can easily log in and view the contact details. 
This reduces dependence on the manual system which earlier required a lot of paperwork. It also saves time and the cost of paper.
All the records are safely stored in the Files and the primary key values along with the RRN (offset) will be stored 
in the primary key indexing file. Searching will be made easy by storing the primary key and searchable attribute in a 
secondary indexing file.

### Hardware Requirement
As the system hardware requirements are minimal. User needs only a computer as the system resides on the local host.

### Software Requirement
•	Python3
•	Tkinter librar
